# Max LED Lighting
This project solves the Max LED Lighting problem using Dynamic Programming. Given two circuit boards, one containing power sources (S) and the other containing LEDs (L), the goal is to connect each LED to its corresponding power source through unshielded wires to maximize the number of lit LEDs.

# Features
Dynamic Programming Solution: Utilizes a dynamic programming approach to efficiently find the optimal solution.
Simple Input Format: Takes the number of LEDs (n) and a permutation of numbers representing the ordering of the LEDs as input.
Output Results: Prints the maximum number of LEDs that can be lit, along with the LEDs that achieve this maximum and a demonstration of the result.
Scalability: Can handle large test cases efficiently by generating a dynamic programming table.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides clear and understandable output to facilitate interpretation of the results.
# Usage
Run the program by providing the number of LEDs (n) and the permutation of LED ordering as input.
The program will output:
-The maximum number of LEDs that can be lit.
-The dynamic programming table.
-The LEDs that achieve the maximum result.
-A demonstration of the result in a user-friendly format.
